# Deep Learning Tales

Hello traveller! 👋

Welcome to my little corner of the internet—I'm not sure why you're here, but since you are, let me take you along on my deep learning journey!

This is a personal series where I learn deep learning from scratch. Don't expect any rocket science—think of this as a simple digital notebook where I:

- Track what I read 📚
- Write down notes and thoughts ✍️
- Solve interesting problems (or at least try to!) 💡
- Explore topics that catch my eye 👀

**Why am I doing this?**  
Mostly for myself! But if you stumble in and find something helpful, or if you want to join in, you're more than welcome.

## What You'll Find Here

- My notes and summaries on deep learning concepts
- Code snippets and experiments
- Reflections on what I've learned (and what confused me💅🏼)
- Links to resources I found useful

## Who is this for?

- Curious beginners
- Fellow learners who like seeing messy, real learning journeys
- Anyone who wants to see someone start deep learning from scratch

## How to Use This Repo

- Browse the folders and files by topic or date
- Try out code samples (if you dare🫦!)
- Suggest resources or corrections via issues or pull requests

## Disclaimer

I'm not an expert, just a learner sharing my notes. There will be mistakes, misunderstandings, and wild guesses. Take everything with a pinch of salt and always check original sources.

Thanks for stopping by, and happy learning!
