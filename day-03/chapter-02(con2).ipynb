    "### Parametric vs. Nonparametric learning\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm is either unsupervised or supervised, and either parametric or nonparametric.\n",
    "Whereas the previous section on supervision is about the type of pattern being learned,\n",
    "parametricism is about the way the learning is stored and often, by extension, the\n",
    "method for learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "| A parametric model is characterized by having a fixed number of parameters, whereas\n",
    "| a nonparametric model’s number of parameters is infinite (determined by data).\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let’s say the problem is to fit a square peg into the correct (square)\n",
    "hole. Some humans (such as babies) just jam it into all the holes until it fits somewhere\n",
    "(parametric). A teenager, however, may count the number of sides (four) and then search\n",
    "for the hole with an equal number (nonparametric). Parametric models tend to use trial and\n",
    "error, whereas nonparametric models tend to count. Let’s look closer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised parametric learning\n",
    "Supervised parametric learning machines are machines with a fixed number of knobs (that’s\n",
    "the parametric part), wherein learning occurs by turning the knobs. Input data comes in, is\n",
    "processed based on the angle of the knobs, and is transformed into a prediction.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the dataset, I’ve identified three clusters in the data that you might want the parametric model to find. They’re indicated via formatting as group 1, group 2, and group 3. Let’s propagate the first datapoint through a trained unsupervised model, as shown next. Notice that it maps most strongly to group 1.\n",

    "### Nonparametric learning \n",
    "\n",
    "Nonparametric learning is a class of algorithm wherein the number of parameters is based on data (instead of predefined).This lends itself to methods that generally count in one wayor another, thus increasing the number of parameters based on the number of items being counted within the data. In the supervised setting, for example, a nonparametric model might count the number of times a particular color of streetlight causes cars to “go.” After counting only a few examples, this model would then be able to predict that middle lights always (100%) cause cars to go, and right lights only sometimes (50%) cause cars to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Traffic lights](nonparametric-learning.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this model would have three parameters: three counts indicating the number\n",
    "of times each colored light turned on and cars would go (perhaps divided by the number\n",
    "of total observations). If there were five lights, there would be five counts (five parameters).\n",
    "What makes this simple model nonparametric is this trait wherein the number of parameters\n",
    "changes based on the data (in this case, the number of lights).\n",
    "\n",
    "This also illuminates that parameters is a generic term, referring only to the set of numbers\n",
    "used to model a pattern (without any limitation on how those numbers are used). Counts\n",
    "are parameters. Weights are parameters. Normalized variants of counts or weights are\n",
    "parameters. Correlation coefficients can be parameters. The term refers to the set of\n",
    "numbers used to model a pattern. As it happens, deep learning is a class of parametric\n",
    "models. We won’t discuss nonparametric models further in this book, but they’re an\n",
    "interesting and powerful class of algorithm.\n"

    "\n",
    "You learned that supervised machine learning is a class of algorithm where you learn to predict one dataset given another and that unsupervised learning generally groups a single dataset into various kinds of clusters. You learned that parametric algorithms have a fixed number of parameters and that nonparametric algorithms adjust their number of parameters based on the dataset.\n",

    "Deep learning uses neural networks to perform both supervised and unsupervised prediction. Until now, we’ve stayed at a conceptual level as you got your bearings in the field\n",
    "as a whole and your place in it. In the next chapter, you’ll build your first neural network, and all subsequent chapters will be project based. So, pull out your Jupyter notebook, and let’s jump in!"
