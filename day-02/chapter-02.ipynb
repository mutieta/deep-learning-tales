    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a subfield of computer science\n",
    "wherein machines learn to perform tasks for which they were not explicitly programmed.\n",
    "In short, machines observe a pattern and attempt to imitate it in some way that can be either\n",
    "direct or indirect.\n",

    "![Machine learning](machine-learning.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "I mention direct and indirect imitation as a parallel to the two main types of machine\n",
    "learning: supervised and unsupervised. Supervised machine learning is the direct imitation\n",
    "of a pattern between two datasets. It’s always attempting to take an input dataset and\n",
    "transform it into an output dataset. This can be an incredibly powerful and useful capability.\n",
    "Consider the following examples (input datasets in bold and output datasets in italic):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the **pixels** of an image to detect the *presence or absence of a cat*. \n",
    "- Using the **movies** you’ve liked to predict *more movies you may like*.\n",
    "- Using **someone’s words** to predict whether they’re *happy or sad*.\n",
    "\n",

    "Supervised learning is a method for transforming one dataset into another. For example, if\n",

    "Monday for the past 10 years, and a second dataset called Tuesday Stock Prices recorded\n",

    "into a bunch of labels. Why are the labels numbers? The algorithm doesn’t tell you what the\n",
